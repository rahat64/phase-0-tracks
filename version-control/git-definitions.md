# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    - > Version control is a system that records changes made to various files throughout the course of important projects. It is very useful because it allows us to recall specific versions throughout each itteration.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    - > Branches help to visualize a moving point through which we commit changes in git. To make an initial commit, we need to start out with a root or in this case, a master branch. This can be identified as the home base or safe zone. From this point forward, we can start creating sub branches and keep the main branch pristene because we can never be too sure how bad we might mess up in these sub branches. When we do mess up, we can simply delete the sub branch and go back to our master branch which which won't be affected by the changes made in sub branches until we merge.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    - > Committing in git is basically creating a save point for whatever project that is currently being worked on. A good commit message is usually detailed and contain every bit of information on changes that were made since the last commit. 
* What is a merge conflict?
    - > In git, merging occurs when the user trys to integrate contents from sub branches to the main one. However, situations that involve two people working together on the same file making various changes can have different results and git won't know which changes to apply. This in turn will create what is known as a merge conflict
