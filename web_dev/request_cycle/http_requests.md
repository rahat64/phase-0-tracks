## 9.1 Research Questions

>Status codes are three-digit numbers. A 200 code is the most common and represents a successful response.

## Some common ones include 
 1. 404 Not Found - This is the most common error code. The status code
 means the requested resource is no longer available or possibly just
 doesn't exist anymore.
 2. 403 Forbidden - This is another common client-side status code. Getting
 this code back from a request means that access to the resource is forbidden
 3. 500 Internal Server Error - 500 error is the catchall error for when
 other 500 errors don't make sense.
 4. 503 Service Unavailable - Like many of the 500 level error cores, the 503
 error could be a temporary problem. Due to reasons unknown, this means that
 the web server isn't available.
 5. 504 Gateway Timeout - This indicates that a proxy servr needs to 
 communicate with a secondary web server, such as an apache server, and 
 access to that server timed out.
