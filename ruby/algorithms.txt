1.) Algorithm for using an elevator for a robot.

- Stand in front of the elevator doors
- Between both the doors, there will be two buttons
    - one up arrow, and the other down arrow
    - If the intention is to ascend, press the up arrow
    - If the intention is to descend, press the down arrow
    - Wait for one of the elevator doors to open
    - When open, go into the elevator
- Once inside there will be more buttons along the side of the
  entrance
    - The buttons will consist of various numbers representing
      each floor that the elevator can go to
    - Access memory databanks to recall which floor needs 
      to be attended
    - Once determined, press the button representing the floor
      number that needs to be attended
- Observe a monitor located to the top center of the doors
    - Pay attention to the number that appears on the moniter
    - Once the number that was pressed on the button appears 
      on the monitor, wait for the doors to open.
    - Exit the elevator once the door opens and the 
      destination should be reached.

2.) Common life struggle (Waking up to the Alarm)

- Set alarm before going to bed 
    - If your ears often fall deaf to the alarm, set it to an
      hour before the intended time
    - Make sure to wind it back up to AM if it's set on PM
    - Also take into acount for military time if that's 
      your preference
- Go to sleep
- Once you hear the alarm, get off the bed!
    - If you set the alarm an hour early, hit the snooze 
      button and go back to bed
    - The snooze effect will kick in every 10 minutes 
    - Continuosly get off bed every 10 minutes to hit snooze
    - Get off bed for good when the intended time of 
      awakening arrives
    - Don't hit the snooze button, instead disable alarm 
      completely until next intended use
- Wake up!
